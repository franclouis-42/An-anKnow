                <!-- Content here -->
                <p>
                    Most of the participants interviewed said that An-annong is experienced when a living encounters a soul. This is supported by Apostol's published book (2010) which claims to experience An-annong after an encounter with the spirit of a dead person.

The soul of the dead can cause someone to feel strange when visiting the said soul's house. These souls are said to have a need and favor to ask or  might have been disturbed. There are also spirits that cause An-annong because the living angered them or had caught their interest. The Ilocanos believe that the soul returns to the land of the living after 9 days of awakening and must be welcomed back on occasions when the deceased appears in a dream or when a family member suddenly experiences an inexplicable disease (National Museum of the Philippines, 2021).

                <!-- Content here -->
                <p>
                    Human criticism is also one of the causes of An-annong. According to An-annong healers, it is usually children or babies who experience it. Similarly in other regions, An-annong is also called usog or bati, which causes pain when greeted by other people (Espiritu, 2022).

According to a mantatako (healer) who was interviewed, the An-annong is more dangerous when caused by the living than the dead or the soul because the person can get sick, die and lose weight. An-annong or usog can be anything from stomach ache to high fever, especially babies are vulnerable to it (Limos, 2020).

                <p>
                    Most of the interview participants experienced physical sensations, from headaches and stomachaches to having a fever as a symptom of An-annong. This is like Harold McArthur Jr.'s experience in 1973 in a remote area in Ilocos Norte where he felt dizzy and vomited for an inexplicable reason. Other people quickly decided that he was suffering from An-annong.

                <p>
                    There are some people who experienced a case of An-annong wherein their symptoms are the same with the disease of the dead person. This is in line with the belief of Ilocanos that the soul of the dead is the reason why a member of the family suddenly becomes sick with a disease with no identifiable cause (National Museum of the Philippines, 2021).

                    It can also be known that a person has An-annong through the rituals of magtatakos (healers). Different rituals are performed to find out if a person has An-annong. Some use rice, and others use basins, and prayers.

                <p>
                    According to the healers or agtaktako that were interviewed, the use of medicinal plants is helpful in treating a person who is suffering with An-annong. The leaves of atis (Sugar Apple), guyabano (Soursop), atsuete (Annatto), andadasi (ringworm bush), lime, guava, and horseradish are commonly used to treat An-annong. These are used by hitting or bathing the person who is suffering from An-annong.

                <p>
                    There is also a method in treating An-annong through rituals and prayers. Scattering rice around the house helps to get rid of the feeling of naan-annongan. The healers shared that they also use their belief in God to heal people. “Apo tulungan nak tapno makatulong nak ti kasapulan ti tulong mo, babaen ti pammatik kenka, tulungan nak, awagak ti nagan na,” which translates to God help me in order for me to help those in need, with my faith on you, help me, is one of the prayers the healers use to help those who experience An-annong.

                <h2>Treatment through massage</h2>
                <p>
                    Another method to treat An-annong according to the participants of the interviews is to massage the body. The wiping of saliva and signing of a cross on the affected person's stomach and forehead helps to remedy the symptoms. In traditional Filipino families, the visitor will be asked to smear saliva on the baby's forehead or belly to remove the feeling that a baby feels when it has An-annong (Martinez et al., 2019). In addition, most of the participants said that pagpekpekkel or massaging the body is also a way to get rid of An-annong. For this to happen, the one who will massage the affected person must be the family member or relative who took care of the deceased. It can also be done by the person who last saw the dead before they passed away. The old clothes of the dead are also used in pagpekkel.

                <p>
                    One of the ways that people do in order to avoid experiencing An-annong is to say "tabi-tabi". It is a way of saying "excuse me" or "I'm sorry" in fear that the spirits may cause them pain, fever, rash or other ailments if they are not recognized or given respect (Clark, 2022).

                <p>
                    Another method that is done to prevent experiencing An-annong is offering to the dead. The atang or alay is performed as a pacification ritual for the deceased who may have been hurt or upset (National Museum of the Philippines, 2021). The ritual is deeply related to the Ilocano people's belief in spirits and the need to appease them when they are disturbed or hurt (Corpuz, 2020).

                    Most of the interview participants believe that a person can pass away because of An-annong. It is said that when a person experiences usog or bati, he or she is immediately affected by an ailment. When An-annong is severe, it can lead to death if not treated early (Abante Tonite, n.d.).

                <p>
                    It is not believed to be fatal but you will feel weak and sick. This illness can cause abdominal pain and high fever. This disease is usually cured by gently hitting the person affected with malunggay by and guyabano leaves. In cases involving infants, the person causing the rash is sought out and told to smear his or her saliva like medicine on the child's forehead or stomach. When you are sick, you suddenly feel dizzy and shaky or suddenly have a stomach ache. The 'spell' will be broken by countering it. Often, the inexplicably ill will wake up soon after, as if nothing had happened and feel sick (Odon, 2015).
